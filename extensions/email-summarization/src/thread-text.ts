/**
 * Turning mail into the text a model is actually shown.
 *
 * Three things have to happen before a body is worth sending anywhere. It has
 * to be plain text, because an HTML body is mostly table scaffolding and the
 * model would spend its attention on layout. The quoted tail has to go, because
 * a ten-message thread repeats message one ten times and a summary built from
 * that says the same thing ten different ways. And the whole thing has to fit a
 * budget, because bodies are attacker-controlled and unbounded.
 *
 * The HTML conversion and the quote cut are the APP's implementations, imported
 * from the SDK rather than rewritten here. A second quote-marker list is the
 * worst kind of duplication: both copies keep returning a plausible string while
 * they drift apart.
