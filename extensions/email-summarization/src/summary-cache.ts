/**
 * Remembering a summary so it is paid for once.
 *
 * A summary costs an AI call — money, a few seconds, and on a metered key a
 * quota. Opening the same thread twice must not cost it twice, and neither must
 * summarizing on arrival and then opening the mail.
 *
 * The key is a hash of the exact text the model was shown, not the message or
 * thread id. That is what makes the cache correct without a TTL: identical text
 * has an identical summary forever, and a thread that gains a reply renders to
 * different text and so misses, which is precisely when it should. An id-keyed
 * cache would have to guess at staleness and would serve a summary that stops
 * one message short.
 *
 * Writes go through the SDK's flush scheduler because the storage backend an
 * extension is given rewrites its whole JSON file synchronously per `set`.
