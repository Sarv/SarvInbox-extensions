 * resources directory in a packaged build, or a folder the user picked from
 * their Downloads. None of those have a node_modules beside them, so the entry
 * point must carry everything it needs. `@sarvinbox/extension-sdk` is imported for TYPES
 * only (`import type`), which erases at compile time and leaves no require.
